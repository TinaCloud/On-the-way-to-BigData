## Spring 2015

This is the 2nd semester in Statistics. I am taking four courses: 

1. Experimental Design & Analysis, 
2. Statistical Inference, 
3. Linear Models Theory, 
4. Comunication and collaboration in Statistics. 
 
My first project is about response surface methodology. I am trying to solve a optimization problem. The model used is hierarchy variable selection.

I started learning Python, JMP.

In March, I had a telephone interview with Alibaba for a data scientist internship in Shanghai or Hanzhou, China. It failed me. I realized that I could apply for different positions, including traditional statistician and data scientist. For the data scientist position, I have to learn a lot by myself, for example, SQL and Python. The interviewee was interested in the project that I have done.

Online courses took:

1. Statistical learning / Trevor Hastie
	- [@Stanford Online](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesandScience/StatLearning/Winter2015/about)
2. Machine Learning (by Prof. Andrew Ng) in coursera,	 
 
Books read: 

1. Head First Python,
2. Introduction to linear algebra / Gilbert Strang
3. Experiments: planning, analysis, and optimization / C.F. Jeff Wu
4. Linear models in statistics / Alvin C. Rencher
5. Statistical Inference / George Casella
6. SQL必知必会(第3版)

## Fall 2014

I begin my first semester in Statistics. I took four courses:

- Probability and Distribution Theory, 
- Inference Fundamentals, 
- Regression and ANOVA,
- and Programming packages in Stats.

I took the first on-campuse interview with W.L.Gore for an entry-level statistician position in ShenZhen, China. It failed me, but the experience was great and impressive. Anyway, I had a weak statistics background.
 
Skills learned: Latex, R and SAS.

## Aug 2014
I took online courses:

1. R programming in coursera, 
2. Linear Algebra (by Prof. Gilbert Strang) in MIT open courseware.

## Jun 2014
I was luckily admitted to the Statistics Department, so I transferred from CHEM to Statistics and started my new career.
